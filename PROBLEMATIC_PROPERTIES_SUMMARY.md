## 🏠 **Key Properties Needing Attention**

### **High Priority (Clear property names from slugs)**:

1. **KIMS Hospital** → Should be a hospital/medical property
2. **Calangute Market** → Should be a Goa property near Calangute
3. **Mapusa Market** → Should be a Goa property near Mapusa
4. **St. Mary's Convent High School** → Should be a school-adjacent property

### **Weather-based Titles (need property names)**:

- `winter-octfeb-pleasant-and-cool` → **Winter Resort Property?**
- `winter-novfeb-2230c` → **Winter Retreat Villa?**
- `winter-dec-feb-mild-and-dry` → **Winter Holiday Home?**

### **Long Infrastructure Titles (need simplification)**:

- `indus-international-school-35-km-hyderabad...` → **Property near Indus School, Hyderabad**
- `st-xaviers-college-9-kmmall-de-goa...` → **Property near St. Xavier's, Goa**

## 💡 **Suggested Approach**

### **For Manual Data Entry:**

1. **Use the property slug as reference** - It often contains the actual property name
2. **Check the description field** - May contain the real property details
3. **Set realistic prices**:
   - **Villas**: ₹1-3 Crores
   - **Apartments**: ₹50L-1Cr
   - **Farmland**: ₹30-80L
   - **Holiday Homes**: ₹1-2Cr

### **Priority Order:**

1. **Fix clear property names first** (KIMS Hospital, schools, etc.)
2. **Handle weather-based titles** (create meaningful property names)
3. **Simplify long infrastructure titles**
4. **Correct corrupted prices**
